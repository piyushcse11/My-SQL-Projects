# SQL Case Studies 
Welcome to my SQL Case Study where in I am using dataset from mode.com.

You can go to mode.com and work on the datasets provided by them. They have a huge resource of dataset to practice. 

Steps I followed:

Login to mode.com                                          
Export the required dataset(by default .csv format)                           
Open your MySQL Workbench.                                     
Create a new database 'casestudies' using command 'create database casestudies'                  
Run the SQL command 'use casestudies' to work in the specific database                               
Import the .csv dataset downloaded from mode.com                                   
The .csv dataset will be imported in current database i.e., 'casestudies'                          
Run 'Select * from table_name' to view your imported dataset.

Once all above steps are performed successfully, jump right into deriving insights from your data.
